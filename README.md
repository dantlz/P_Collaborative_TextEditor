# P_Collaborative_TextEditor


This is a text editor that allows users to collaborate on documents. The user interface is implemented with the Java Swing framework. Eclipse is the ideal IDE to run this program.

Notable features include:
- Serverthread design using concurrent programming, networking, and database to allows any number of users to collaborate on a document in real time.
- Signup/login function that stores the hashed user information in a SQL databse via server calls
- Save/open files from both the online database and harddrive storage
- Add/remove users from your document to give/remove permission.
- Removed usera are kicked off the document in real time
- Sync the changes from multiple devices in real time, like Google Docs

This is the readme file for my collaborative text editor.
